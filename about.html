          Hi, I am <a href="https://morg.systems/">Morg</a>, the main creator of
          this website. Thanks for dropping by.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website contains an <b>opinionated</b> list of games for Japanese
          learners to immerse with for the purpose of studying Japanese (and to
          have fun).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is completely <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb">open source</a>
          and hosted on Github for everyone to tinker with. I am not a web
          developer, and the layout of the website shows. If you find problems
          or want to contribute some fixes, please feel free to send me a pull
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for creating this website is because I play <b>a lot</b> of
          videogames in my spare time, and I have also learned Japanese <b>mostly</b>
          from playing videogames. I thought I could contribute back to the
          community by having a list of games with my own notes about my own
          personal experience with them. For this reason, this list is <b>opinionated</b>.
          It is not meant to be an objective representation, there are many other
          websites that do a much better job at that. It's just how I approached
          these games and how I felt when I played them. If you want to add new
          games to this list, you can try sending me a patch, the <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb/tree/main/data">data</a>
          is pretty straightforward to edit and generate, but I cannot guarantee
          I will accept it unless I agree with the contents from my own experience.
          Please understand it is a "me" thing.
