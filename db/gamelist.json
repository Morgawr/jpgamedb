        "notes": "\n\n\nDragon Quest X Offline (not to be confused with the online version) is a remake of the Dragon Quest X online MMO but meant to be played offline as a single player campaign. The story and world is the same as the MMO version, however the gameplay is slightly different. One thing that differs from the online version is that it also has an option to turn on furigana in every dialogue. This makes it quite interesting for beginners and is very beginner friendly.\n\n\n\nThere are however two downsides that I want to point out:\n\n\n\nThe “full” furigana option does not cover things like quest logs and tutorial windows, so those can be quite hard/tricky to read. Especially if you are lost with a certain quest and don’t know where to go.\n\n\n\nAs is normal Dragon Quest tradition, there’s a lot of puns, and most characters speak with some weird speech quirks and accents which can be quite hard to understand as a non-native speaker.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, while it looks like a child/beginner friendly game, it might not be as easy once you get deeper into it.\n",

        "notes": "\n\n\nThis is THE JRPG. The classic. The one, true, and only Final Fantasy VII. It's such an amazing game.\n\n\n\nLanguage-wise, this game is surprisingly not that complicated. It falls in the category of old(er) JRPGs where due to language/font limitations they didn't use a lot of weird or unknown kanji, however it also does not plaster your face with full kana which is good. If you are average at reading Japanese text and know your fair share of jouyou kanji, I think you will do fine with the vocabulary in this game.\n\n\n\nThe downside is that since it's an older game, there are no quest markers or UI indicators to aid you in your quest and if you cannot follow the story (or play with a walkthrough), you will likely feel a bit lost. There is also no voice acting and no backlog.\n\n\n\nOverall, I was conflicted if I should rate this as \"easy\" rather than \"average\" in difficulty, but I chose \"average\" due to the length. Had it been a shorter and more linear game, I'd have definitely considered it \"easy\".\n",

        "notes": "\n\n\nThe game is a sequel to FF7 Remake. The difficulty is mostly the same, however the amount of text and length of the game overall makes it slightly harder than its predecessor in my opinion. The combat system is also a bit more complicated and if you were overwhelmed by the skill system of its predecessor, this one will probably be a bit worse.\n\n\n\nLanguage-wise, it is not particularly hard but for a learner it might feel overwhelming. There is pretty much no furigana that I can remember, and there is no way to pause the text (unless you pause the entire game) or to scroll back to previous text logs as there is no dialogue history. On top of that, you often have dialogue from random NPCs in the various towns that is hard to track if you are the kind of person that pays attention to all those details.\n\n\n\nOn the good side, everything is fully voiced, including the most minor NPC interactions, which is very good to see. Also, the map is very clear with quest markers and events and makes it very obvious where you need to go, so even if you can't understand what characters are saying, you will always know where to go.\n",

While I think the original was pretty average in language difficulty, I think the remake series of games can be significantly harder to follow. The dialogue is not pausable, as all converastions are voiced and in real time, and there is no backlog to refer to in case you feel lost.\n\n\n\nThe language itself (word choice, etc) is not particularly complex after you become familiar with some in-universe words, as is common for most JRPGs. I'd still consider it to be on the hard end of JRPGs due to how \"active\" and non-pausable it is in nature.\n",

The only thing I strongly advise against are the very first Pokemon games (on GameBoy). Those do not use any kanji and the kana is super small due to display size limitations, it’s extremely hard for beginners to recognise where words start and end. You will not have a good time.\n\n\n\nThis said, Pokemon Sword/Shield are on the other hand excellent and very easy to follow for the most part. Despite being RPGs, the story is very linear and even if you end up not understanding some plot points, you will almost never be “stuck” on a puzzle or not knowing where to go.\n\n\n\nA big downside however, if you are used to the English version of these games or Pokemon in general, is that a lot of Pokemon name and combat moves are significantly different. So you might feel a bit lost when it comes to Pokemon names (and they are always full of puns you might not understand yet).\n\n\n\nBe sure to play the game with kanji and not in kana only (there’s different options in the settings). You’ll still get a lot of kana, but at least the kanji will help.\n",
