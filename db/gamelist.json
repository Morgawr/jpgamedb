        "notes": "\n\n\nThe game is an absolute masterpiece of narrative and will keep you glued to the story until the very end (at least it did for me). I consider it the equivalent of \"one more turn\" memes from the Civilization strategy games, except in an adventure form (\"one more dialogue\").\n\n\n\nWhile the game itself presents a story that is very convoluted and shown from the point of view of many characters (of which the player can decide the playthrough order), in reality the game does a very good job at presenting it in a very linear fashion. Chronologically, it can get very confusing to know who did what in which order but it's part of the charm of the game, and even if you don't fully understand all details of the story you can still more or less easily navigate the scenarios and reach the end without getting stuck.\n\n\n\nIt has some combat portions as in some parts it becomes a fully fledged real time tower-defense-like game, and at that point I felt like the difficulty in the language spiked quite a bit. There are a lot of skills, a lot of upgrade systems, a lot of mechanics, and overall I did not personally find that part very enjoyable. For that reason I just played it on \"casual\" difficulty so I could focus on the story which is what interested me the most. If you are like me and struggle with the battle parts, I recommend doing the same as you won't regret it.\n\n\n\nThe dialogue in this game is for the most part \"pausable\" as it waits for your input to continue, so you can read it somewhat leisurely, however there are some parts that are somewhat \"timed\". This is because as you proceed through dialogues, there sometimes are some other scenes happening in the background as other characters go do their own things, and if you don't read fast enough and interact with them before they are gone, you will get locked into a specific route. But the game makes it easy enough to go back and retry, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.\n\n\n\nThe ending dialogue, however, is completely unpausable and I found it a bit frustrating. There's a bit of lore dump as you get explained a lot of crucial parts of the plot with some complex words and you cannot pause it, but overall it's not too bad if you managed to get that far.\n\n\n\nOverall, the lack of furigana hurts a bit, but the fact that the game is entirely voiced and aside a few sci-fi terms sprinkled throughout the story, I'd say the language difficulty is pretty average for this kind of adventure game.\n",

The story and world is the same as the MMO version, however the gameplay is slightly different. One thing that differs from the online version is that it also has an option to turn on furigana in every dialogue. This makes it quite interesting for beginners and is very beginner friendly.\n\n\n\nThere are however two downsides that I want to point out:\n\n\n\nThe “full” furigana option does not cover things like quest logs and tutorial windows, so those can be quite hard/tricky to read. Especially if you are lost with a certain quest and don’t know where to go.\n\n\n\nAs is normal Dragon Quest tradition, there’s a lot of puns, and most characters speak with some weird speech quirks and accents which can be quite hard to understand as a non-native speaker.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, while it looks like a child/beginner friendly game, it might not be as easy once you get deeper into it.\n",

It falls in the category of old(er) JRPGs where due to language/font limitations they didn't use a lot of weird or unknown kanji, however it also does not plaster your face with full kana which is good. If you are average at reading Japanese text and know your fair share of jouyou kanji, I think you will do fine with the vocabulary in this game.\n\n\n\nThe downside is that since it's an older game, there are no quest markers or UI indicators to aid you in your quest and if you cannot follow the story (or play with a walkthrough), you will likely feel a bit lost. There is also no voice acting and no backlog.\n\n\n\nOverall, I was conflicted if I should rate this as \"easy\" rather than \"average\" in difficulty, but I chose \"average\" due to the length. Had it been a shorter and more linear game, I'd have definitely considered it \"easy\".\n",

The difficulty is mostly the same, however the amount of text and length of the game overall makes it slightly harder than its predecessor in my opinion. The combat system is also a bit more complicated and if you were overwhelmed by the skill system of its predecessor, this one will probably be a bit worse.\n\n\n\nLanguage-wise, it is not particularly hard but for a learner it might feel overwhelming. There is pretty much no furigana that I can remember, and there is no way to pause the text (unless you pause the entire game) or to scroll back to previous text logs as there is no dialogue history. On top of that, you often have dialogue from random NPCs in the various towns that is hard to track if you are the kind of person that pays attention to all those details.\n\n\n\nOn the good side, everything is fully voiced, including the most minor NPC interactions, which is very good to see. Also, the map is very clear with quest markers and events and makes it very obvious where you need to go, so even if you can't understand what characters are saying, you will always know where to go.\n",

You will not have a good time.\n\n\n\nThis said, Pokemon Sword/Shield are on the other hand excellent and very easy to follow for the most part. Despite being RPGs, the story is very linear and even if you end up not understanding some plot points, you will almost never be “stuck” on a puzzle or not knowing where to go.\n\n\n\nA big downside however, if you are used to the English version of these games or Pokemon in general, is that a lot of Pokemon name and combat moves are significantly different. So you might feel a bit lost when it comes to Pokemon names (and they are always full of puns you might not understand yet).\n\n\n\nBe sure to play the game with kanji and not in kana only (there’s different options in the settings).

The remake itself is quite amazing honestly and the artstyle is very charming.\n\n\n\nLanguage-wise, it's pretty average for a sci-fi fantasy game, there are a few technical terms here and there that might throw people off a bit, and some made up words that you kinda need to intuit from context but that also aren't really fundamental to understand the core of the story.\n\n\n\nFor whatever odd reason, the text rendering engine does not support furigana at all, but sometimes the writers will throw in some alternative readings or help the player with some readings by adding the kana in brackets next to the word, but it's relatively rare (maybe like 10-15 times in a whole playthrough).\n\n\n\nThe game has a lot to read, and a very broad set of characters with two main characters and two different storylines/point of views so there's quite a decent replayability. Not all characters can be recruited in each playthrough so if you are the kind of person to enjoy exploring all options, you'll be stuck playing this game for a while (there are apparently 99 different ending combinations, with all character pairs).\n\n\n\nIt is \"mostly\" fully voiced for the main story and side content, including most of the character personal actions (like private skits), although a few here and there aren't voiced for some reason. All other interactions with random NPCs in town are not voiced though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that felt a bit overwhelming was the complex skill and crafting system. There is a lot to do and a lot of options to customize and make builds, although by the end you are able to acquire all or almost all of skills/passive boosts so I wouldn't worry too much about it. There is quite a bit of menu reading though and the descriptions can be a bit hard to follow.\n\n\n\nSpecifically for this last reason, I decided to mark it as hard in language difficulty rather than average.\n\n\n\nOne thing to also keep in mind is that there is a dialogue log scrollback that can be viewed, however it is only accessible during cutscenes and as soon as the cutscene ends or changes the scrollback is wiped and cannot be accesssed anymore, which is why I marked it as partial instead of full.\n",
