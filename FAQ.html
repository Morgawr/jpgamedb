        <h3>How do the difficulty ratings work?</h3>
        <p>
        <a id="difficulty"></a>There are five different difficulty ratings:
            Very Easy, Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no JLPT levels because the JLPT does not follow native media
          resources, however my expectation is that someone between N5 and N4
          should probably be able to dip their toes into <i>Very Easy</i> games.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the ratings follow the order in succession. You can probably
          expect a game marked as <i>Very Hard</i> might require even a native
          speaker to whip out a dictionary a few times.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>I don't agree with some ratings. I think $GAME was easy and not hard.</h3>
        <p>
          <a id="rating"></a> These ratings are subjective and entirely personal.
          It's completely normal if you disagree and found some game easier or
          harder than listed here.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many factors that make it hard to rate games. Things might
          appear easier than they are if you are already advanced/native with
          the language, so what you consider easy might be hard for someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, a lot of people these days play games with <b>texthookers</b> and
          translators to more easily look up words they don't know or figure out
          sentences they don't understand. Depending on the kind of player you
          are, you may or may not end up thinking something is easier than it
          would be otherwise. <b>I do not</b> use texthookers or translators and
          my dictionary lookups are very minimal when I play videogames, so I
          base my judgment around that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine me playing these games lounging on the couch. I don't want to
          whip out <a href="https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan">yomitan</a> to
          do that, because I am lazy.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Why not just use JPDB/natively/etc?</h3>
        <p><a id="othersites"></a> There are a lot of other amazing sites and
        collections of resources that show the difficulty of native media. To
        name a few:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://jpdb.io/prebuilt_decks">JPDB.io</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://learnnatively.com/">Natively</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w42HEKEu2AzZg9K7PI0ma9ICmr2qYEKQ9IF4XxFSnQU/edit#gid=1999205540">TMW's Japanese Media Recommendations Spreadsheet</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://wiki.wareya.moe/Narou">Wareya's Narou difficulty stats</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you haven't yet, I recommend taking a look too, this is not a
          competition. This site is <b>my own</b> take on videogames
          specifically. Everyone has different ratings and different experiences,
          if you vibe with what I write here, you will find it useful, otherwise
          a more collective approach like the ones listed above might be more
          useful to you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What does the "Playtime Length" stat mean?</h3>
        <p><a id="playtime"></a> Each game has a "playtime" approximate
          statistic showing how much of a time investment you should expect. The
          possible values are as follow:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Very Short - under <b>2 hours</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Short - bewteen <b>2 and 15 hours</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Average - between <b>15 and 30 hours</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Long - between <b>30 and 100 hours</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Very Long - more than <b>100 hours</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously these numbers are just approximations based on my own
          experience (I am quite a slow gamer) and memory. I also try to link to
          sites like <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/">HowLongToBeat</a> or
          <a href="https://vndb.org/">vndb.org</a> whenever possible so you can
          also look at more aggregate data from multiple players. However keep
          in mind that most of those numbers are usually recorded on non-Japanese
          versions of the game, and if you're a beginner with Japanese it might
          take you longer than that.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>What does it mean when something is 'unknown'?</h3>
        <p><a id="unknown"></a> Some of these games I have backlogged from my
          experiences in the past, and for that reason I do not remember exactly
          if they have certain features like scrollback, furigana, voice acting,
          etc. Also, some games do not have links to external sites like
          <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/">Backloggd</a> to track them, so I
          cannot fill in all the data required. Whenever some data is missing,
          it will show up as <i>unknown</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find some entries that have missing data that you think you can
          contribute, please file an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb/issues">
          project's issue tracker on Github</a> and I will take care of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward with new entries I will make sure to fill in all the
          data I can while I am playing the game, so there should be less and
          less gaps.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>I have an entry I want to contribute, can I?</h3>
        <p><a id="contribute"></a> The answer is... yes and no. It's a bit
          complicated. I am trying to keep this list a personal list of games
          with my own opinions and notes. For this reason, I cannot guarantee
          that I will accept all or even most of external contributions
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this does not mean that contributions aren't welcome either!
          If you feel strongly about contributing a certain game to the database
          and it is a game I recognize and am familiar with, and also if I end
          up agreeing with your judgment, I will gladly accept your contribution
          to the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know it's not very welcoming to ask you to go through all the effort
          with a chance of being rejected anyway, but it is how it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the project is <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb">
            fully open source</a> and if you feel like it, you can fork it and
          even host your own version of it.
        </p>
        <p>
        The database is just plain text files you can find <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb/tree/main/data">
          here</a> and all you need to do is to just regenerate the json table
        using <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb/blob/main/script/build_db.py">
          this python script</a>. Incidentally, the process to contribute a new
        entry is very similar too. You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Morgawr/jpgamedb/blob/main/data/template.txt">
          template file</a> to see how the data format works (it's very rudimentary).
        You can remove any rows in the table (except the title) without breaking
        the format too.
