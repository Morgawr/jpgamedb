## Notes

Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception is the sequel to Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen and the first entry in the "Mask" dualogy.

While it is entirely possible to start the series from this entry, as the story is mostly self-contained, I strongly recommend to read Prelude first since the experience will be so much better that way.

All in all, the difficulty is not that different from Prelude and most of the stuff I mentioned about Prelude will apply to this game as well.

The main difference that I noticed is that the writing style changed quite a bit from its predecessor. This one feels much more like a "proper" visual novel. There are a lot more descriptions, narrative parts, and non-voiced portions that are more common to see in visual novels than videogames. Although there are still gameplay elements, they seem much less than in Prelude.

For this reason, and because the length is much longer too, I consider the difficulty to be a bit higher and rate it as "Hard" rather than "Average".

Still, it's probably one of the best visual novels I've ever read and I strongly recommend it. In my opinion it has the absolute most amazing ending of any piece of written media I've ever read and it's totally worth it.
