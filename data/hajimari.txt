## Notes

Trails into Reverie / Hajimari no Kiseki is a standalone entry that merges the storylines of the Crossbell dualogy (Zero, Ao no kiseki) and the Erebonian quadrilogy (Cold Steel) into a grand finale of a story. If you haven't played (at the very least) Trails of Cold Steel, you should not be playing this because it would be very confusing.

There are multiple routes with multiple protagonists, and the game is split between a main story and some dungeon exploration with side events and lore explanations in a similar fashion to Trails in the Sky the 3rd.

Language-wise, there is some complicated lore and background exposition, but I felt it was not as hard into politics like the Cold Steel series, so I think "hard" rather than "very hard" is a reasonable assessment.

The rest of the game plays pretty much the same as its predecessors, so by now you should be very familiar with how these games work.
