## Notes

Cold Steel 2 is the second entry in the Cold Steel arc of the Trails / Kiseki series.

My commentary/notes for this game are pretty much the same as those for Cold Steel 1, so I just recommend reading those. But anyways, you shouldn't really be playing this game unless you have at least played Cold Steel 1, as the story is a straight continuation of its predecessor.

If you managed to get through Cold Steel 1, you'll do fine with this one too.
