Playtime Long

## Notes

Kuro no Kiseki 2 is the sequel to Kuro no Kiseki 1 (duh) and it plays out mostly the same. There's not really much to say about it, except maybe the playtime is a bit shorter than its predecessor (still pretty long). Language-wise, it's pretty much the same, and if you haven't played Kuro 1 you really shouldn't be playing this.
