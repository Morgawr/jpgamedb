## Notes

Language-wise, I'd say the game is of average difficulty. If you've played other JRPGs before, you will probably have no issues following this one too.

The gameplay/combat is not particularly complicated and the skill descriptions are pretty straightforward.

Unfortunately not all dialogues are voiced, even in the main story quest you get a decent chunk of grunting and unread text boxes which raise the difficulty a bit. Also, some characters speak with funny accents.
