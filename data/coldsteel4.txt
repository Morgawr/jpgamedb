Playtime Very Long

## Notes

This is the culmination of the Erebonian quadrilogy of the Trails / Kiseki series.

Overall, this is mostly the same as its predecessor. There are a few more quality of life improvements but language/feature-wise it plays out the same as Cold Steel 3. The story keeps getting more complicated and the lore expands, so I still consider this to be very hard, and the length of this game was astronomical to me. There's a lot of side content and side quests.

If you did fine with Cold Steel 3, you'll do fine with this one too.
