## Notes

Eustia is probably one of the most widely acclaimed VNs out there. If you are into dark fantasy stories and want some real good time with some enthralling story, this is the VN for you. I'm still riding on the high of this narration and I wish more VNs were like this. As someone who does not enjoy slice of life and time wastes with filler events in VNs, Eustia hit all the right spots for me.

Language-wise, I was conflicted on whether to consider it "average" or "hard". I opted to go with "average" because realistically speaking the level of language used in it is not that different from most average VNs, however as a beginner I remember struggling quite a bit with it and I had to postpone it and come back to it after a few years.

The VN is mostly voiced for all dialogues (including the protagonist), however as is usual for the majority of VNs, it doesn't have voices for narration.

There is some furigana mostly used for made-up words, ornamental purposes, and for the occasional rare kanji vocab.

Kanji-wise, it sometimes uses alternative forms for some words (like 水甕 instead of 水瓶) but for the most part it's relatively straightforward.
