## Notes

Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is the sequel to Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception and the conclusion of the main Utawarerumono trilogy.

It is the second half of the story that follows from Mask of Deception. These two games should be considered pretty much the same as one is a direct continuation. The language is exactly the same and gameplay elements as well.

For this reason, I rate it exactly the same as Mask of Deception. I recommend reading that entry for more details.
