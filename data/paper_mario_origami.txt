## Notes

Very cute game. The gameplay itself is quite straightforward and not that complex (it is a kids game after all). Some of the battles with bosses become tricky later on and there are explanations/notes on how to solve them, so testing your understanding of the language is actually quite useful.

The game has full furigana support and is relatively easy to follow. There’s a few instances of weird speech (either archaic or some other speech quirks) but for the most part it shouldn’t be too hard. There are a few word puzzles and trivia with wordplays that might get tricky but, again, it’s a good test of understanding.
