## Notes

Hogwarts Legacy is clearly not a Japanese game, so as always with non-Japanese games translated into Japanese, my recommendation would be to just play it in the original language instead. For language learning there are much better options with more natural Japanese.

This said, if you are a fan of Harry Potter, and want to stick to full Japanese immersion, I think this game does a decent job at capturing the Hogwarts experience. The game is fairly large, with lots of side quests and side activities to do. The language itself is fairly complicated though, in pure Harry Potter fashion, there's lots of made up names and puns and stuff like that. It is fully voiced though, which is a strong point.

On the other hand though, despite being fully voiced, I found the lip syncing and voice acting to be very lackluster, and while the translation is not bad, a lot of the Japanese feels a bit unnatural or at least "western". It is clear it is a translated game.

For people who like reading, there is A LOT of lore and codexes and books and stuff to read on top of the normal game as well, which might be interesting if you really like Harry Potter.

Overall, I consider the language in the game to be somewhat hard, made it worse by the fact that most cutscenes and dialogues cannot be paused.
