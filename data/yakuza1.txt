## Notes

This is another possible entry point for people new to the Yakuza/Ryu ga gotoku series.

More or less, it's about the same complexity as Yakuza 0, except there's a bit less kansai dialect and a lot more yakuza slang.

If you managed to get through Yakuza 0, you should be fine with this one too. If not, you might struggle a bit as you get up to speed with the Yakuza slang. Refer to the Yakuza 0 entry for more details and comments about the difficulty of the series.
