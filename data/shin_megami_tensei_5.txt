## Notes

I'll be honest, I did not like this game and I dropped it after about 15-20 hours or so.

Gameplay aside, story-wise the game seemed okay. I was actually getting interested in the story but... unfortunately it felt like there wasn't enough story between the mindless gameplay/battle portions.

The game also felt very frustrating to read as a lot of demons speak with weird speech quirks or weird speech styles (like all katakana, etc). Every interaction you have, you have to sit through all these demons speaking in very annoying ways.

The language itself also often uses difficult kanji or grammar.

This said, I still put it on "average" difficulty because despite all this, most of the narrative portions that don't involve talking with random demons actually use pretty normal Japanese, and there's not much reading anyway so it's hard to get lost.

If you like the SMT type of dungeon crawling and some pseudo open world/open area type of gameplay, maybe this game is for you. For me, unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it much.
