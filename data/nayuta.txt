## Notes

Just from the title, Nayuta no Kiseki might look like just another Trails / Kiseki game, but it's an almost completely different thing. It is a spin-off story that takes place in a completely different world, with different characters, and the gameplay is also very different. It's an action JRPG with levels/stages, rather than a pseudo-open world turn based party based JRPG. You take control of one and only one character: Nayuta, and have to swing your sword and use magic to defeat enemies.

The story is not too complicated and is partially (but not entirely) voiced. I think overall it's a very nice entry into the genre if you're not a complete beginner anymore and want a bit of a healthy (but not too much) challenge.

Playtime-wise it's not very long, at least compared to the other kiseki games, and it does not overstay its welcome.
